# Yardoc RESTful Web Service Plugin

originally by [vWorkApp](http://www.vworkapp.com)
rewritten for 0.3.0 by [rknLA](http://github.com/rknLA) with substantial help from [lsegal](http://gnuu.org/)

A plugin for [Yardoc](http://yardoc.org/) that generates documentation for RESTful web services. 

## Install
    sudo gem install yard-rest

It also requires the Jeweler gem if you plan to use the rake build tasks.

## Generating Docs

When using yardoc you ask it to use the "rest" plugin (the --plugin option). For example: 

    yardoc --plugin rest --title "Our App's API"

## Gemfile functionality

You may also include yard-rest in your gemfile using:

    gem 'yard-rest'

You may need to include the following dependencies as well:

    gem 'redcarpet'
    gem 'yard', '~>0.7.4'

If you include yard-rest in your gemfile, you should generate docs using bundle exec:

    bundle exec yardoc --plugin rest --title "Our App's API"

## Writing Comments

In addition to starting your comment with the normal RDoc description. The following tags are provided:

- @url url. Specifies the URL that the service is accessed from. This tag is compulsory, only **classes** and **methods** that include this in their comments are included.

- @topic topic. Specifies the topic to categorise a **class** (not a method) under.

- @required_argument [type] name description. Specifies an argument that must be passed to the service. You can specify as 
    many of these as you need.

- @optional_argument [type] name description. Specifies an optional argument that may be passed to the service. You can specify as 
    many of these as you need. 

- @example_request example. An example of the request that is send to the service.

- @request_field name description. Further specifies the fields that are send within the request.  This is useful when the service 
    accepts only one argument that has many fields, like a JSON or XML string.

- @example_response example. An example of the response that is returned from the service

- @response_field name description. Further specifies the fields that are returned within the response

- @response_code

- @header

- @image

## Ignored Documentation

This plugin only documents **classes** and **methods** with **@url** tags. It does not support module documentation.

The rationale here is that you are documenting external services (as represented by controllers and methods), and not internal code.

Both controller *and* methods must have @url and @topic tags to be included in documentation.

Methods with the @overall tag will be ignored.

## Example:

    ##
    # Retuns all samples, as XML, for the current user that match the given parameters.
    #
    # @url [GET] /samples.[format]?[arguments]
    # @url [GET] /samples/index.[format]?[arguments]
    # 
    # @required_argument [String] format Only "xml" is support at this time.
    # @required_argument [String] name The name of the sample
    # @required_argument [String] resource The resource that sample belongs to
    # @optional_argument ["@assigned"|"@complete"|"!@complete"] search Return samples that are assigned, complete, or
    #   uncomplete.
    #
    # @example_response
    #   <samples type="array">
    #     <sample>

## Development

As always, you can see what tasks are available by running:
    
    rake -T

You can run the template locally over the included sample code by using the following rake tasks:
    
    rake ex:clean
    rake ex:generate
